# VolumetricSNN
This project is an experiment to reconstruct 3D volumes from 2D depth maps.
## Target:
  representing a cube fishtank filled with water
  each pixel in an image determines the displacement by:
    "Block Units (representations of  pixels in squares)"

## Goals
  ### Alternative to the Structure from motion algorithm
      Determine camera positions through forms of movement in a resivour displacement model
  ### Reconstruction via resivour displacement
